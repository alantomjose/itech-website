          Why Compliance Matters in Retort Processing

          <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
            If you&apos;re in the business of ready-to-eat or shelf-stable foods, regulatory compliance isn&apos;t optional — it&apos;s your ticket to market access and consumer trust.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
            Among all regulations, US FDA compliance stands out as one of the most important and demanding. Whether you export to the U.S. now or plan to in the future, meeting FDA&apos;s 21 CFR Part 113 and 114 for thermally processed low-acid and acidified foods gives your business a solid foundation for growth and acceptance in global markets.

          <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
            At ITECT, we understand the pressure food processors face to comply with complex regulations. That&apos;s why our PRIME series retorts are engineered from the ground up to meet all key requirements — especially those set by the U.S. FDA.

              <span className="font-semibold">FDA-Compliant by Design</span>
              <br />
              Our retorts are tailor-made to meet the FDA 21 CFR Part 113 and 114 standards — covering everything from temperature control and pressure to documentation and safety interlocks. When a Process Authority creates your scheduled process, our machines execute it accurately and consistently, every time.

              <span className="font-semibold">Built-in Process Integrity</span>
              <br />
              Each batch is processed with precise time-temperature control, with optional Fo/Po monitoring and alarms for any deviation. This ensures your products reach commercial sterility without overprocessing — maintaining both food safety and quality.

              <span className="font-semibold">Complete Traceability</span>
              <br />
              ITECT PRIME retorts log every step of the process — temperature, pressure, time, and alarms. These records can be easily reviewed, exported, and submitted during audits or FDA inspections.

              <span className="font-semibold">Deviation Detection & Safety Lockouts</span>
              <br />
              If a process deviation occurs (for example, if temperature doesn&apos;t reach the required level), the system flags it and holds the batch until reviewed — exactly how FDA expects it to work.

              <br />
              ITECT works closely with your Process Authority to make sure the retort is ready for validation and easy to operate within your scheduled process. We also help ensure you&apos;re equipped for FCE/SID filing if you&apos;re exporting to the U.S.
