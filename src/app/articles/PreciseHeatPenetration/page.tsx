            In retort food processing, accuracy in temperature monitoring is not optional—it&apos;s essential. Even the slightest deviation in sterilization can turn a safe product into a public health hazard. Under-processed food can support the growth of dangerous pathogens like <span className="italic">Clostridium botulinum</span>, posing serious threats to consumer safety and brand reputation. That&apos;s why sensor reliability is at the heart of safe, efficient, and FDA-compliant retort processing.
